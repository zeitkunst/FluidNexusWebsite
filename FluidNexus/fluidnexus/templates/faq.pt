            </div>
            <h2 i18n:translate="">What networking technologies does Fluid Nexus use?</h2>
            <p i18n:translate="">At the moment Fluid Nexus uses Bluetooth and link-local wifi.  Bluetooth works on the order of 10 meters and was primarily designed as a point-to-point local wireless protocol.  On Android the Bluetooth support is somewhat subpar but we have worked around as many of the issues as we could.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">Link-local wifi refers to a local wifi connection before it has passed from one router to another.  In other words, if you had a home wireless router, link-local wifi would refer to the possible connections between any of the machines directly connected to your wireless router.  Fluid Nexus uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroconf">zeroconf</a> protocol (known as Bonjour on OS X) to automatically discover other devices running the software.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">While it may seem counter-intuitive to use a wifi technology in software that purports to not need access to the Internet, it has to be noted that wifi is not predicated on Internet access.  Indeed, even if there would be no direct Internet access, devices connected to the same link-local wifi router could still form a network amongst themselves.  And if access to the internet was removed for whatever reason, people could still open their wifi routers to enable others to share information using software such as Fluid Nexus.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">Everything just said regarding link-local wifi is also applicable if you are connected via ethernet.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">We are planning on implementing an ad-hoc wifi feature in the near future, thus obviating the need to connect to an existing wifi network.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82">Unnecessary limitations</a> in most Android implementations are making this more difficult than it should be.</p>
            <h2 i18n:translate="">Why does my Android phone require pairing to another device?</h2>
            <p i18n:translate="">Unfortunately the Android OS requires pairing before any Bluetooth data connection can be made.  This is beyond our control, sorry.</p>
            <h2 i18n:translate="">Why can't other devices see my Android phone using Bluetooth?</h2>
            <p i18n:translate="">Unfortunately Android has an annoying "feature" that limits discoverability to only 120s or 300s at a time.  This is ostensibly for security purposes.  This is a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6348">known "bug"</a> that is theoretically fixed in later versions of the OS.  There is nothing we can do about this other than popping up an authorization windows every 120s&mdash;which is something we don't want to do.  In order to make data sharing over Bluetooth as smooth as possible, then, ensure that any Desktop devices you have running the software are set to be discoverable.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">Additionally, you can pair the devices you are interested in connecting to prior to use of Fluid Nexus in the field.  The Android application will always try and connect to paired devices&mdash;if they are nearby&mdash; along with any other devices that it discovers.  Once an Android phone has paired with another device, it will always be able to connect to it (assuming it's in range), regardless of its discoverability.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">Finally, we have provided the option for users to make the device discoverable for a short period of time through a menu option.</p>
            <h2 i18n:translate="">Can malicious users of Fluid Nexus spread counter information?</h2>
            <p i18n:translate="">Indeed they can!  Yet this is nothing new.  We trust that Internet users are capable of deciding for themselves the veracity of news posted to services such as Twitter or the New York Times.  We have decided to let this be worked out in use through decisions by the users, rather than enforcing any particular technological approach.</p>
            <h2 i18n:translate="">Is information passing through Fluid Nexus encrypted?</h2>
            <p i18n:translate="">There's two issues to consider here: encryption of messages stored on a device, and encryption of messages as they pass from one device to another.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">Regarding encryption of stored messages on a device, at the moment <strong>messages and received files are not stored encrypted</strong>.  On Android, we plan on incorporating <a href="https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/">sqlcipher</a> in a near-future release.  On the Desktop, we do not plan on implementing any form of message encryption within the software itself.  We believe encryption on platforms like Linux and Windows is better taken care of using native tools, such as an ecryptfs encrypted home directory, LUKS encrypted disk, or TrueCrypt encrypted volume.  All of these options already exist, but it is beyond the scope of this FAQ to explain how to set them up.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">Regarding encryption of messages and data as they pass from one device to another, we do not necessarily see the point of this given the current broadcast model of Fluid Nexus.  Since anyone running the software will receive all messages sent by other users, encryption does nothing to prevent eavesdropping; all someone has to do is run a copy of the software in order to read the messages.  This is by design; oftentimes it is better to spread messages to anyone, even if they are an adversary.  (This could be considered a "Twitter"-like model of information distribution.)  Additionally, encryption of messages from one device to another requires some sort of trust model whereby you can verify that another device is really who or what it claims to be.  With e-mail this accomplished via a web of trust and signed keys; with SSL-encrypted websites, for example, this is currently accomplished via certificate authorities (but see also the <a href="http://convergence.io/">convergence</a> project).  We would have to import one of these models into the Fluid Nexus project in order for encryption to make any sense.</p>
            <p i18n:translate="">On the other hand, it might be possible to send directed, PGP encrypted e-mails via the Fluid Nexus system.  This would expose your recipient's e-mail address to others, but the title and the message content could be encrypted.  This is something we are considering for a future release.</p>
            <h2 i18n:translate="">How can I send encrypted files using Fluid Nexus?</h2>
            <p i18n:translate="">It <em>is</em> possible to send encrypted attachments right now.  All you have to do is encrypt the file offline using another piece of software such as <a href="http://thialfihar.org/projects/apg/">Android Privacy Guard (APG)</a> (making sure to retain the same file extension) and then add the file as an attachment to your message.  Others won't be able to view the attachment.  The message text will be sent in plaintext, however.  Your recipient will have to know to decrypt the message offline.  All attachments are saved in the folder <code>FluidNexusAttachments</code> at the root of your internal SD card.</p>
